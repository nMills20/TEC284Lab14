Using a camera to recognize hand gestures (rock paper scissors)
Using a camera connected to a raspberry pi, we captured around 200 photos of hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors respectively. We then used Teachable Machine to train a model that would recognize what rock paper and scissors looked like. Finally, we used python to run code making a game between the user and the computer.
